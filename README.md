# Game-Of-Life

* Cellular Automation Evolutionary Simulation
* Zero Player Game
* Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one
* Different Patterns occuring such as Still Lifes, Oscillators, Spaceships
* Turing Complete

## Rules

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
